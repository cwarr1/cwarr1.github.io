  <p>
    Our affinity diagram explores ideas surrounding how college students can eat healthy meals that are both affordable and quick to prepare. We grouped over twenty ideas into five main clusters: Meal Preparation & Delivery, Cost & Budgeting, Nutrition & Ingredients, Technology & App Features, and Marketing & Partnerships. The diagram helped us visualize connections between convenience, affordability, and health, guiding us toward building an efficient app-based meal solution.
